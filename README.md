# The-study-of-defazzification-methods-to-identify-expert-bias-using-confidence-intervals

Study of defuzzification methods in triangular fuzzy number on the results of ranking alternatives: an experimental comparison of defuzzification methods in the Confidence Interval method.

# About
This repository presents an experimental study of how different defuzzification strategies applied to triangular fuzzy numbers affect the detection of biased experts using confidence intervals.

The work focuses on modifying the preprocessing stage of expert evaluations by applying various defuzzification methods and analyzing their impact on the sensitivity and stability of the confidence-interval-based bias detection algorithm.

The prototype and experiments were developed as part of a research project on group decision-making methods.
